  "aboutProject": "<p>Puttered is a 2D golf game that was created by my friend and I as a requirement for the Mobile Game Development module of our University Course. It is based on the popular mobile game <strong>Super Stickman Golf</strong> and contains two courses, each with 9 holes to play.</p><p>The game was built for mobiles but is also playable in a desktop browser. It was written in Javascript and HTML5, using the <strong>Phaser.js</strong> framework for all the loading, rendering and general gameplay, along with <strong>Box2D</strong> as the physics engine. Each course has its own online leaderboard with playres scores stored in a MYSQL Database, which the game communicates with using a PHP layer and some AJAX requests.</p>",
